# Raffle Picker ðŸŽ‰

This is a simple web-based raffle picker that allows you to randomly select multiple winners from a list. It removes the selected winner from the list after picking and plays an audio clip to indicate when a winner has been selected.

## Features

- **Multiple Winner Selection**: Randomly picks a winner and removes them from the list.
- **Audio Feedback**: Plays a sound when a winner is picked.
- **Reset Option**: Allows you to reset the raffle and start the process over.
- **Fully Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes and devices.

## How to Use

1. **Add Your Names**: The raffle starts with a default list of names. You can modify the `names` array in the JavaScript section to include your own names.
   
2. **Pick a Winner**: Click the "Pick a Winner" button to randomly select a name from the list. The winner will be displayed, and their name will be removed from the list.

3. **Reset the Raffle**: Click the "Reset" button to restore all names and start the raffle again.
